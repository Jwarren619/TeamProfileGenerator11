## Usuage
When I start the application, I will first check and make sure my test run smoothly with the, "npm test" command. Once every test has passed, I wil start the application with "node index.js".


## Authors and Acknowledgment
I would like to thank my instructors for always pushing me and understanding how hard coding can be at a fast pace.
